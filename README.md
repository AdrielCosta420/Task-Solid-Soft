# Task Solid Software.

This project was developed as a task proposed by Solid Software. In order to analyze the technical performance.
This is a Flutter app that modifies the background color according to the user's touch anywhere on the screen. Furthermore, it was added
an incremental counter when the user touches the screen. When the user reaches 5, 10 and 15 touches, a SnackBar is displayed.
